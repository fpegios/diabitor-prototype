#  Diabitor Prototype

## Prerequisites
  - NodeJS

## Instructions
Execute the following command to load dependencies:
```sh
$ npm install -g gulp-cli
$ npm install
```

Run the project
```sh
$ gulp
```

*NB* The project can be run without the gulp client, by running `index.html` instead -- the node dependencies should be installed either way.

```sh
$ gulp clean
```
